# ML-Math-Bridge
Bridging Mathematical Foundations with Practical Machine Learning
📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my learning journey through the mathematical foundations of machine learning, focusing on building deep intuition rather than just using formulas.
The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between abstract math concepts and real ML understanding using:
simple explanations
practical examples
small experiments
and real datasets 

This is a long-term learning repository and will grow alongside my studies.

🎯 Why This Repository Exists
Many students learn machine learning tools without fully understanding the math behind them.
This repository is my effort to:
understand concepts deeply
explain them in plain language
connect theory with practical ML
and build a solid foundation for future research and engineering work
