# 📐 ML Math Bridge

### *Intuition-first Mathematics for Machine Learning*

> A clean, student-built repository that bridges **linear algebra → geometry → machine learning**,
> following *Mathematics of Machine Learning* by **Tivadar Danka**

## 🌟 What is this repository?

**ML Math Bridge** is a structured collection of **clear, intuition-driven notes** built while studying the mathematical foundations of machine learning.

This repo is **not a copy of the book**.
It is a **learning companion** — rewritten explanations, simplified intuition, and clean summaries made by a student, for students.

The goal is simple:

> **Understand ML math deeply enough to reason, not memorize.**

## 🎯 Who is this for?

* Computer Science / AI / Data Science students
* Beginners struggling with ML mathematics
* Self-learners preparing for ML, DL, or AI research
* Anyone who wants *clarity over formalism*

---

## 📚 Reference Book

This repository follows the structure and philosophy of:

**📘 *Mathematics of Machine Learning***
by **Tivadar Danka** (Packt Publishing)

The book focuses on:

* Linear Algebra
* Calculus
* Multivariable Calculus
* Probability Theory

This repo tracks that journey from a **student’s perspective**.

## ✅ Content Covered So Far

### 🟦 Part I — Vector Spaces (Foundations)

* Feature scaling intuition
* Vectors as data
* Vector spaces & subspaces
* Linear combinations
* Span
* Bases (including trivial vs proper subspaces)

### 🟦 Part II — Geometric Structure of Vector Spaces

* Norms & distances
* Inner products & angles
* Similarity interpretation
* Orthogonal & orthonormal bases
* Gram–Schmidt process

📌 These topics form the **core geometry behind ML models**, PCA, projections, and optimization.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most ML learners face one of two problems:

1. Math that is **too abstract**
2. ML that is **too hand-wavy**

This project aims to sit **in the middle**:

* ❌ No heavy proofs
* ❌ No buzzword-only explanations
* ✅ Strong intuition
* ✅ ML-focused motivation

---

## 🛣 Roadmap (Coming Next)

* Matrices as linear transformations
* Rank, null space, and information loss
* Eigenvalues & eigenvectors
* PCA intuition
* Least squares & projections
* Optimization foundations
